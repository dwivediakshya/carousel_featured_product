          <p>Which sofa design is best?
            Best Sofa Design | Add Glamour With Sofa Design Ideas by Livspace
            Rectangular and L-shaped sofas are the best for most homes as they can offer more seating and
             define the space. However, be sure that the sofa shape you choose fits into the size of your 
             apartment before buying it.</p>

            <h3>STUDY ROOM</h3>
            <p>A study room should be well-organised, outfitted and adorned to boost productivity. This does not, 
                however, imply that it must be austere or uninteresting. If the study area is for your children,
                 it should be created with the correct furniture and colour schemes to encourage creativity and concentration. </p>
